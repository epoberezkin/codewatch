Identify and deeply analyze only the most security-critical ~10% of this codebase. Focus exclusively on:
- Authentication and authorization entry points
- The most exposed attack surface (public API endpoints, user input handlers)
- Cryptographic operations and key management
- The riskiest code patterns you can identify
Provide a targeted, high-signal assessment. Skip boilerplate, tests, and low-risk utility code.

The files provided have been pre-selected by a security-informed planning phase that analyzed grep patterns, component security profiles, and the project's threat model. These represent the highest-priority ~10% of the codebase.

Identify and deeply analyze only these most security-critical files. Focus exclusively on:
- Authentication and authorization entry points
- The most exposed attack surface (public API endpoints, user input handlers)
- Cryptographic operations and key management
- The riskiest code patterns you can identify
Provide a targeted, high-signal assessment. Every file provided was selected for a reason — analyze each one carefully.
